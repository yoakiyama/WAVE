# WARM Virtual Emulator (WAVE)
Welcome to our WAVE repository. This WIND program hosts a virtual version of a WARM program. Warm is
an ARM-like RISC processor, while the Wind is similar to an Intel x86-like processor.
After evaluating the emulator on ten tests, the WAVE program passes all tests with an average speed of 24.15 
and an average footprint of 1716.90. Speed is determined by calculating the ration of the number of instructions
the emulator performs and the the number of instructions executed by the WARM interpreter. Thus, the average speed
represents the average ratio between these two values across the ten tests.
